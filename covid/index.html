        Hello,
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm a software developer living in Seattle and I want to volunteer my technical skills for any COVID-19 related project. I'm not currently working and available to start immediately (today).
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're working on something related to COVID-19 (modeling, testing, deploying resources in the community, communicating technical concepts to the public, creating maps) and you think I could help, then I want to work (remotely) with you.
      </p>

      <p>
        If there is a project you wish existed, but you don't have time to initiate or manage it, let me know.
      </p>

      <p>
        My skills include:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Algorithms & data structures (studied computer science)</li>
        <li>Software engineering (worked at Google)</li>
        <li>Front end / back end web development</li>
        <li>Data visualization (charts, maps, tables)</li>
        <li>Communicating technical concepts to laypeople</li>
        <li>Interactive media (games, interactive simulations, graphics)</li>
        <li>Fair math & science literacy</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        My skills <strong>do not</strong> include:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Rigorous statistical application</li>
        <li>Deep knowledge of biology, virology, epidemiology</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        My guess is that if you're working on COVID-19, you don't have time to ramp someone else up and manage them. But there might be work which you could hand off to me without much management on your part. Let's talk to see if we can identify those items.
      </p>
