# &#x1F4B2; Donation drive

6/9/20

For every $1 donated to the **ACLU** or **Rainier Scholars** we will match $5 until we reach $1500
in donations. Help us reach a total of $9000! Send a receipt of your donation to
[@space.filler.art](instagram.com/space.filler.art/) on Instagram, or email it to
[hello@spacefiller.space](mailto:hello@spacefiller.space).

The police's murder of George Floyd is the latest episode in an ongoing nightmare of police
brutality against Black people in America. In honor of George and in an effort to effect change,
we're partnering with friends and their employee matching programs to create a small donation
matching fund.

## &#x2139;&#xFE0F;&nbsp; Basic info

**Duration**: Noon (PST), 6/9/20 &mdash;Â Noon, 6/11/20

**Match**: A $5 to $1 match for all donations to either [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/) or [Rainier
Scholars](https://www.rainierscholars.org/)

**Limit**: The 5:1 match stays active until we reach $1500 (for a match of $7500 and a total of
$9000 donated). If we pass the $1500 mark, we may be able to match the extra amount at less than a
5:1 ratio, but this is not guaranteed.

**How to get matched?**: Send a screen shot of a donation receipt to
[@space.filler.art](instagram.com/space.filler.art/) on Instagram, or email it to
[hello@spacefiller.space](mailto:hello@spacefiller.space). After the donation drive is over, we will
tabulate the received donation receipts and apply our match. We'll post a break down of the grand
totals to our instagram and upload it here.

## &#x1F3E2;&nbsp; Why these organizations?

Firstly, we wanted to focus on only one or two organizations for this drive, because we believe too
much choice might be a barrier to attracting donors. Other organizations can be selected for future
drives, and our criteria can be refined along the way.

Because a substantial portion of the match is coming from a corporate sponsor, we were limited to a
pre-approved list. We searched this list for organizations relating to racial justice and then
evaluated them according to the following criteria:

-   **Does the organization specifically address police violence against Black people?**

    There's momentum & energy around this issue. Organizations that focus on police violence have an
    opportunity to make an impact *right now*.

-   **Are they sympathetic to an [abolitionist
    perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_abolition_movement)?**

    Although we understand that an incrementalist approach to police reform can be practical and
    should be pursued, we also think it's important to consider defunding or abolishing the police
    in parallel with these incremental efforts. Reform isn't working fast enough. Let's try
    something different.

-   **Does the organization retain lawyers and win court battles?**

    We think that precedents set in court can have a huge impact.

-   **Is the organization transparent about how money is used?**
-   **Does the organization offer data on the effectiveness of their programs?**
-   **Is the organization active in the Pacific Northwest?**

    We're from Seattle and want to see change in our own community.

Based on this criteria, we decided to select a national organization and a local (to Seattle)
organization:

-   National: **[ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/)**

    The ACLU specifically addresses police violence against Black people, supports defunding the
    police, retains lawyers and wins legal battles.

-   Seattle-based: **[Rainier Scholars](https://www.rainierscholars.org/)**

    Rainier Scholars offers a 12-year program to low-income students of color, with the goal of
    helping those students graduate college. While not directly related to curbing police violence,
    we believe that education is the optimistic long game. These bright students can go on to become
    leaders in their communities and effect change.

    We liked the focus of this organization: they do one, simple thing, so it's obvious where your
    money goes. We're also impressed that 93% of students supported by the program graduate (or are
    on track to graduate) from college.
